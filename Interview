Salesforce Architect Interview Practice Pack

Summary of Questions Asked

Trigger Method Call

Can we call the same method inside a trigger?

Key points: recursion risks, bulkification, static variables.

Static Variables in Triggers

Will static variables fail since triggers process records in batches of 200?

Key points: static variables are transaction‑scoped, shared across the batch.

Large Data Volumes

If 20,000 records are processed, will static variables still handle recursion?

Key points: yes, but only per batch; resets across transactions.

Trigger Framework

Designing a metadata‑driven trigger framework.

Key points: custom metadata to control trigger execution, modular action classes.

Multi‑Team Governance

How to handle multiple teams working on the same object (e.g., Account).

Key points: governance, record types, layouts, trigger frameworks, packaging.

Apex Design Patterns

Explanation of Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator.

Layman analogies + Salesforce mappings.

Singleton Deep Dive

Example of Singleton for caching custom metadata.

Clarification: with 2,000 records, Singleton instantiates once per batch (10 times).

Static Variable Reset

Confirming static variables reset to default after each transaction.

Batch + Trigger + Future Method

What happens if a batch updates records and trigger calls a future method?

Key points: queued async execution, 50 future call limit, bulkification.

Queueable Apex Alternative

Example of replacing future methods with Queueable Apex.

Key points: chaining, complex parameters, modern best practice.
